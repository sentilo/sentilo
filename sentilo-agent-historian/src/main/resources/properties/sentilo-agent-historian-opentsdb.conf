# This property allows configuring which Sentilo's events must be persisted in OpenTSDB
# 
#    subscriptions=topic1,topic2,...,topicN
#
# where each topic must follow the following pattern: /{eventType}/{resourceId}, with:
#  + eventType must be one of the following values: data, alarm or order
#  + resourceId could be any of the following listed below:
#         - *, if you want to export all the events of this type
#         - providerId/*, if you want to export all the events related to the provider {providerId}
#         - providerId/sensorId if you only want to export events related to the sensor {sensorId} from the provider {providerId}
#         - alertId if you only want to export alarms associated with alert {alertId}.
